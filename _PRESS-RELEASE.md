# Dvv.js #

## Dvv it up ##
  > A JavaScript framework for simple distributed computation across connected web clients.

## Share the burden ##
  > Solve computationally expensive operations by dividing the task into more manageable pieces and sharing those pieces across the web with willing helpers. 

## Expensive algorithms are expensive ##
  > Some computations are prohibitively expensive in terms of time. One solution is to distribute the problem across multiple networked machines... a super-computer cluster! But what if you don't have access to a super-computer cluster? Don't give up, dvv it up!

## Crowd-sourced Super Computing! ##
  > Dvv allows you to divide your data into bite-size pieces, just waiting to be solved. When your loyal (and consenting) followers connect to your site, they will be sent a portion of your problem to solve. Once complete, the solution is returned the master client. 

## Inspiring Message of the Day ##
